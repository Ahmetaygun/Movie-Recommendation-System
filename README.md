# Movie Recommendation System
The project was developed using the MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users based on their viewing histories and the content information of the movies. The film recommendation system employs three different algorithms:

Cosine Similarity

User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Filtering

Modules:

film_arama.py

This module implements:


Cosine Similarity

User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Filtering

film_arama2.py

In this module, the watched movies are manually determined, and the Malatya Centrality method is applied.


film_arama3.py

This module randomly selects watched movies and applies the Malatya Centrality method.


Malatya Centrality Details:

In the Malatya Centrality process, graphs are created with 9 movies based on their centrality scores:


5 movies with the highest centrality scores,

2 movies with medium centrality scores,

2 movies with low centrality scores.

The similarities between movies are represented in the graph, and the centrality scores are also indicated.


All project documents, outputs, formulas of the used algorithms, and detailed explanations are available in the file film Ã¶neri sistemi.pdf.
